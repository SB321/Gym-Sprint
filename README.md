# Gym-Sprint

* This project represents an extension of my prior accomplishment, the Gym Workout Tracker, to introduce advanced features and technologies, enhancing the overall experience for fitness enthusiasts and athletes. The Gym Workout Tracker is a comprehensive application developed using Django, designed to keep users organized, motivated, and aligned with their fitness objectives.
* The recent improvements include the integration of SonarQube and ArgoCD. SonarQube, a static code analysis tool, ensures the overall health and quality of the codebase. And ArgoCD is used for the orchestration of Kubernetes clusters. It streamlines the deployment process, allowing for efficient creation and management of Kubernetes clusters.

## Prerequisites: 
  * Ensure you have Docker and Kubernetes installed and configured.

## Docker Containerization: 
  * Create a Dockerfile, build the Docker image, and push it to a Dockerhub(used here) for this Gym Workout Tracker application.

## Kubernetes Deployment: 
  * Deploy Gym Workout Tracker to Kubernetes by defining Kubernetes YAML files for deployment, services. Configure scaling, auto-healing of the application to meet varying traffic demands, ensuring high availability and reliability.
